# Guess the Dice Game
A game of guessing the drawn number.

## About
In this game, the user will guess a number from one to six. A dice will roll and the user's guess will be compared.

#### Rules
- the game master (computer) throws the dice (draws numbers from the range 1..6)
- the player (also the computer) tries to guess the number (also draws)
- if he guesses right, the game ends
- if he does not guess, the next round begins (the computer draws another number and the player tries to guess it)
